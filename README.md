Repair of a laptop that was bluescreening and turning itself off during use

This laptop was brought to me as it had a few issues. The user noted that the laptop was behaving poorly and often turned off during use.
The laptop had two issues, one was that is was turning off under highloads, such as video editing, when this occured there would often but not always be a blue screen.
This error occured whether the laptop was plugged in or not. 
The other issue it had was turning of at random with no warning, this occured whether underload or not but only when not plugged in. 

The first problem took priority for me personally as it was more of a concern that the laptop seemed to turn off only when under heavy load.
The first thing I did was install Speccy. Speccy is a piece of software that tells the user what components are inside of a machine and what temperature these components 
are operating at. It was noted by myself on boot that this machine was booting and running and dangerously high and abnormal temperatures.

My next move was to turn off the machine and disassemble it.

Once disassembled I inspected the inside of the machine for flaws with the fan,heat sink and heat pipes. Upon being satisified with the condition of all three I removed the 
heat sink and pipes.

With the heatsink and pipes removed I could see the quality of the thermal paste on the CPU. I was not happy with the consistency of the thermal paste. The photo below shows what
I was greeted with. However it is to note that some of the thermal paste I had already wiped away in this picture as it had a lumpy cottage cheese consistency and I didn't want
to accidently move the lumps further into the laptop. It should also be noticed that there was a large overspill of thermal paste between the processor chips. 
This is very inefficent and likely to be a cause of the overheating issues this laptop had.

After re-applying the thermal paste I tested the laptop. During this test I kept the laptop plugged into the mains as I didn't want the second fault to occur while I was testing.
I ran Speccy and could see immediate improvements in the boot temperature. I then kept the laptop running and opened some of the software the user had installed to see how
temperature was affected underload. No crashes or extreme temperature spikes occured. I also noted that the changes I made also resulted in the fan running a lot quieter in
this machine.

The last thing I did was order a new battery for this machine. Once I replaced the battery then the second fault disappered. Satisfied I had fixed both causes of sudden power
offs I returned the machine to the user who noted no more issues with the device.
